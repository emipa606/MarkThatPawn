You get a large raid and looking through the pawns you find one that would be excellent to capture, but sadly you lose them in the action. You later find their corpse blown up by one of your rockets.

With this mod you can mark any pawn with a selection of icons to make them easier to keep track of.

Mod-options:
[list]
[*]Change the size and position of the icon
[*]Change the icon-set used 
[*]Relative icon-size based on pawn-size
[*]Increase the icon-size when zoomed out, selectable strength
[*]Have different icon-sets based on the pawn type
[*]Disable the gizmos based on the pawn type
[*]Have the icons pulse like the question mark over traders in a caravan
[*]Show all applicable icons
[*]Rotating the active icon between the applicable icons
[*]Show all icons when hovering the icons or selecting the pawn
[*]Show on corpses
[/list]

You can define rules to make spawning pawns get marked automatically. The rules are defined based on:
[list]
[*]Weapons equipped
[*]Weapon type equipped
[*]Apparels equipped
[*]Apparel type equipped
[*]Pawn skill levels
[*]Pawn traits
[*]Pawn age
[*]Pawn gender
[*]Relations to colonists
[*]Pawn category
[*]Pawn has one or more permanent hediffs, like a bionic limb
[*]Pawn has any bad permanent hediff, like a scar
[*]Animal type
[*]Faction icon
[*]Ideology icon (Ideology DLC)
[*]Ideology role (Ideology DLC)
[*]Royalty titles (Royalty DLC)
[*]Xenotype (Biotech DLC)
[*]Genes (Biotech DLC)
[/list]

There are also priority rules that get applied based on events
[list]
[*]Pawn is drafted
[*]Pawn is downed
[*]Pawn is in a mental state
[*]Pawn has one or more temporary hediffs, like an injury
[/list]

If you have [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895299310]TD Find Lib[/url] active you can add rules that uses its search filters. These filters are saved in the save-game so they require and active game to add or edit.

All applicable rules can also be set to only apply to one category of pawns.
There is also support for the fog of war in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2938891185]CAI 5000[/url]
BadgeDefs from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2526040241]Pawn Badge[/url] will be imported as marker-sets

There are default sets of icons for each type of pawn but you can always set any icon for a specific pawn using the custom option. There is also support for vehicles using [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3014915404]Vehicle Framework[/url].

It is very simple to add more Icon-sets as only a small xml-definition is needed to make it be selectable in the mod options. If you have suggestions for new icon-sets or new rules, please leave a comment here or on the Discord server and Ill see if I can add it to the mod!
