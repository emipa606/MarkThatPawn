    <content>Since the response of the mod was so positive I decided to expand on it further.
It is now possible to change the icon-set in the mod-options as well as have different icon-sets based on the pawn-type.
The icon-sets are now based on xml and it should be pretty simple to add more.
I added two new sets, one with simple numberings and also one with icons based on work-skills.
The latter is based on icons from the Pawn Badge mod, following its included License.
1.3 is now also supported but adding features to both versions is a bit of a pain so only the 1.4 version will see further additions.
If you have any ideas for additional marker-icons, please leave a comment on the mod-page or on the linked Discord server!</content>

    <content>Since it was requested by multiple users there is now mod-options for marking pawns automatically based on various conditions.
These rules will be checked whenever a pawn spawns into the world and will mark them if applicable. The marking can be changed or removed from the pawn if needed.
If you have suggestions for new rule-types, please leave a comment on the mod-page or the Discord-server!

I also added a few more icon-packs; Ideology icons by Yoann, Weapon-types by max.icons, XCOM-icons by Botoxalim, Job-icons by Survivalmaster.</content>

    <content>There are now options to show all applicable icons for pawns. This can be turned off in the settings if you still want to show only the highest priority icon.
You can also choose to rotate the current icon of all applicable icons for the pawn.
Hopefully this will be usable!</content>
