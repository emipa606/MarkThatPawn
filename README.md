You get a large raid and looking through the pawns you find one that would be excellent to capture, but sadly you lose them in the action. You later find their corpse blown up by one of your rockets.

With this mod you can mark any pawn with a selection of icons to make them easier to keep track of.

Mod-options:


- Change the size and position of the icon
- Change the icon-set used 
- Relative icon-size based on pawn-size
- Increase the icon-size when zoomed out, selectable strength
- Have different icon-sets based on the pawn type
- Disable the gizmos based on the pawn type
- Have the icons pulse like the question mark over traders in a caravan



You can define rules to make spawning pawns get marked automatically. The rules are defined based on:


- Weapon equipped
- Weapon type equipped
- Pawn skill levels
- Pawn traits
- Pawn age
- Pawn gender
- Relations to colonists
- Pawn category
- Pawn has one or more permanent hediffs, like a bionic limb
- Animal type
- Xenotype (Biotech)
- Gene (Biotech)



There are also priority rules that get applied based on events


- Pawn is drafted
- Pawn is in a mental state
- Pawn has one or more temporary hediffs, like an injury



All applicable rules can also be set to only apply to one category of pawns.

There are default sets of icons for each type of pawn but you can always set any icon for a specific pawn using the custom option. There is also support for vehicles using https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3014915404]Vehicle Framework.

It is very simple to add more Icon-sets as only a small xml-definition is needed to make it be selectable in the mod options. If you have suggestions for new icon-sets or new rules, please leave a comment here or on the Discord server and Ill see if I can add it to the mod!
